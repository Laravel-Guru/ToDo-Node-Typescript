### Objective

Your challenge is to build out this full-stack todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

Using the language specified by your recruiter, your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Client Side**

Your users should be able to:

-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: Toggle light and dark mode
-   **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

**Server Side**

-   Design a simple API for persisting state on the server side
-   Implement routes for all listed **CRUD** operations
-   No authentication / session management is required. Imagine you're building this application for a single user (yourself)

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Bonterra Team
